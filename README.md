Back in June, 2021 I kept thinking of having something MimbleWimle / Grin related which is wearable. Something I could wear myself or attach to my backpack or bag. Something small, less than a t-shirt or hoodie, especially during hot and humid summer days.

I had an idea for a wristband. The moment [Slatepacks Marketplace](https://slatepacks.com/) was founded I decided it is a perfect opportunity to contribute to ツ economy and do something myself, just for fun.

I have designed two types of wristbands, one in black-white colors and another one in black-yellow. I managed to order a sample of 100 units, I researched shipment and pricing and [made an offer](https://slatepacks.com/post/21). Unfortunately, due to very low value of the wristbands and unreliability in how the post office operates, I had to close my offer.

Just as promised, I am releasing original files under [the Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/) and as a bonus, I will write down how to get those wristbands manufactured so that you can open your own offer and sell them locally!

## Preparation

Wristband files are designed using [Adobe Illustrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator) vector drawing software. As attached to this repository they are perfect for editing, but before printing you would have to do some slight modifications:

1. Make sure you vectorize the text. The printing house might not have the font you want and wristbands will look differently. To do so follow [this tutorial](https://www.lyfepix.com/illustrator-convert-font-vector/). In short, select your text, then go `Type > Create Outlines` in the top menu.
2. Printing house advised me to adjust the color black to make them look better after printing. The one they advised was to replace `#000000` with `#221E1F`. Double check that with your manufacturer.

## Manufacturing

This step is easy and not expensive at all.

1. Go to [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/)
2. In the search field type "custom ribbon event wristband" and you will find many companies ready to print them for you and ship in bulk from China

Before you reach any seller

1. Check at least a dozen of offers, compare their prices and minimum quantities
2. Decide on the types of beads you want, get some extra beads as they get easily lost

Before you place an order talk with every seller and explain what you want. Pay attention to their attitude, if they are helpful and adjusting the design and they seem to know what outcome to expect they might be one to go with.

## Logistics

Your AliExpress seller will handle the logistics including duty and all the fees. How you would ship them to your customers is a different problem. I failed on that so I cannot advise you here...

## Selling

Best part! Go to [Slatepacks Marketplace](https://slatepacks.com/) and open a new offer! Accept ツ payments and start processing your orders!
